# RIDERR
## **Inspiration**
There is no such app that can give us the statistics to optimize our travel - travel across different places at cheap prices. Riderr helps you give the cheapest prices to travel just by a few taps on the screen. With Riderr, you can get the different time during the day when the travelling prices drop to the lowest!

## **What it does**
# Riderr optimizes your travel by giving you the accurate transit data.
# With Riderr, you get price comparisons of the day for travelling from one place to another.
# Riderr also gives you options to book the travelling means directly through the app.

## How we built it
We used Google Location Services API to access the users location. Then, we created a server to put the store the information of prices of travelling means by inspecting the prices during the same time in the previous days using machine learning. We create a graph to see the price comparisons.

## Challenges we ran into

## What we learned

## What's next for Riderr
Using similar algorithm, we will calculate prices for other travelling services in a city so as to provide multiple optimized options to the user for travelling.
