## **Inspiration**
There is no such app that can give us the statistics to optimize our travel - travel across different places at cheap prices. We learnt that travelling can be made cheap and hence, fun using some machine learning. That's why we built Riderr! Riderr helps you give the cheapest prices to travel across the city just by a few taps on the screen. With Riderr, you can get the different time during the day when the travelling prices drop to the lowest. Riderr shows you the correct statistics through a graph that are calculated directly through our machine learning algorithm! (Link: https://github.com/darthcodus/hermes-server)

## **What it does**
Riderr optimizes your travel by giving you the accurate transit data. Through Riderr, we thrive to achieve the same! We learnt that using our machine learning algorithm, we can change the way a person thinks of travelling. Using our app, a user can now get the correctly optimized prices for the entire day for travelling from one place to another. With Riderr, you also get the price comparisons of the day for travelling. We also provide users with options to book the travelling means directly through the app.

## How we built it
We used Google Location Services API to access the users location. Then, we created a server to put the store the information of prices of travelling means by inspecting the prices during the same time in the previous days using machine learning. We create a graph to see the price comparisons, and give the optimal prices during the day.

## Challenges we ran into
The cost-time algorithm to get the correct and optimal price statistics for travelling.
Fixing over 10 crashes in the app and countably infinite memory leaks to make the app stable for proper daily use.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
After extensive hours of bugs fixing, Riderr is in stable mode with no more crashes, and is ready for daily use.
Riderr gives correct statistics calculated by the machine learning algorithm.

## What we learned
We learnt that there is always some way, some thinking through which we can create a good disruptive product that can help the masses.  We applied this approach to achieve our aim in Riderr.

## What's next for Riderr
Using similar algorithm, we will calculate prices for other travelling services in a city so as to provide multiple optimized options to the user for travelling. We plan on releasing it on Play Store very soon!
